ChatGPT is a new Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology developed by OpenAI.

Built this clone of an AI app using React.js and Node.js with an elegant user interface that resembles the
ChatGPT app, communication with advanced GPT3 model API, and most importantly, the ability
to ask the AI for help regarding JavaScript, React, or any other programming language, giving it
code and translating it to another programming language, and much more.

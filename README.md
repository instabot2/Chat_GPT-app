💠 I've built a 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗚𝗣𝗧 𝗔𝗜 app clone using 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁.𝗷𝘀, 𝗡𝗼𝗱𝗲.𝗷𝘀 the 𝗢𝗣𝗘𝗡𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗣𝗜, with an elegant & responsive UI. This project has been a great learning experience and has allowed me to work with cutting-edge technologies.

💠This GPT3 model API has ability to help regarding JavaScript, React, or any other programming language, giving it code and translating it to another programming language, and much more.

💠It's amazing to see the potential of AI and how it can be integrated into real-world applications.
